# Parallel
Parallel
para-comm.sh is a script which can be used to execute parallel commands on servers which have a common user with 
key based authentication. This will help you consolidate output of more than 1000 servers in very small amount of time. 
wrote this first as parallel command was not available by default and had to use xargs.
